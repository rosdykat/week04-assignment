Week 04 Assignment notes

** Notes/Process**

- Before starting the assignment, I had to go back to the "Dtabases:scheme,Tables, and SQL" and "Deploying a Client and Server on Render" modules, as I wasn't fully sure how to do this during the workshop. I practiced creating some basic forms and storing the information on supabase.

- After revisiting the modules, i first created a rough version of the website, consisting of the html for the form and a very basic CSS Grid.

- It felt natural to focus on storing data to the database before I worry about writing any code that creates elements using data from the database.

  - This wasn't too difficult in the end, I think my biggest struggles were understanding what to do in Supabase, I don't fully understand the language used in the SQL editor and for the most part copied what we did in previous modules.
  - As we were only storing text data, this wasn't too difficult but I think I would struggle storing other types of information. However, Overall I think I now know the fundamentals.

- I spent additional time learning about app.get and app.post to really understand their purpose, which helped a lot when creating the code to post stored data from the database to the website.
- Once I understood this better this wasn't as difficult as i initially imagined, as I recognised a lot of code we used in previous weeks, such as appending to the DOM, and stringifying data.

- I've added annotations in my .js files that walk through what each line of code does in "simple" terms, this helps me remember how the code works and gives me something to reference to if I ever get stuck in the future.

- I couldn't figure out how to create a button that deletes information from the batabase. Research suggested creating "app.delete" but looking at examples I couldn't really understand what each line of code meant and did not want to insert anything I did not fully understand.
